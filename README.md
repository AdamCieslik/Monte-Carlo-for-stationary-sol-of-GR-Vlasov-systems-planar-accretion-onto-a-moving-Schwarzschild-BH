1. Keep all files in the same place
2. Extract the "EllipticX.zip" file in the same place as the other files
3. The file "2D-v=095-Demo.nb" presents the basic idea of the work and shows how to build a simulation for counting on a single surface with a constant radius
4. To generate simulations for many different counting surfaces, run the "data_gener.wl" program, which generates initial data. Note in the program file, in the fourth line, "notebookDir="directory of the program file"; " you must set the file location.
5. Based on the generated data, the programs Abs.wl, ScatM.wl, and ScatP.wl will run a simulation. Note in the program file that in the fourth line, "notebookDir="directory of the program file"; " you must set the file location.
